# From Seeing to Mimicking: Evaluating LMMs' Proficiency in Chart to Code Generation

![main_chart](pdfs/main_chart.png)

ChartMimic-500 is a benchmark task that evaluates the ability of multimodal language models to generate code implementations from visual designs. We have conducted a comprehensive study and benchmarking of this task and provide a curated dataset of 500 real-world charts for testing. 

## Overview

This repository provides a detailed overview of the chart to code task, automatic evaluation metrics, and a collection of multimodal prompting methods. 

## Getting Started

To get started with ChartMimic-500, please refer to the instructions in the repository. We provide a detailed guide on how to use the benchmark, apply the evaluation metrics, and fine-tune the models.
